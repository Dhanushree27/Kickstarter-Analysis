# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends and undertstand the performance of previous campaigns based on the Outcomes, Goal Vs Pledged amount, the time of initiation, the duration of campaign and the number of backers. This analysis was carried out for an aspiring playwright, Louise, to help with understanding the below factors:
* Performance of campaigns for plays in the US
* Performance of select plays, as requested by Louise
* Perfomance of campaigns for musicals in GB

## Campaigns for Plays in the US
After analysing the general trend of campaigns, we observed that 'Theatre' campaigns have performed better than other categories with **525** successful campaigns, but it should also be noted that there were **349** failed campaigns as well.

Diving further into the theatre category, we observed that plays are a popular form of campaign with atleast a **50%** success rate.

To identify the optimal time to start the campaign we looked at the success vs failure rates for campaigns started at different times and observed that theatre campaigns initiated during the summer months (May-July) have a higher success rate with **May** being the ideal.

To understand the average goal amount for the campaign, we compared the statistical data for successful and failed campaigns. From the data, we can see that most of the campaigns with the goal amount of **1500-5000** dollars have been successful, with the median value being **3000 dollars**. The pledged amount likewise varied between 1717-5699 dollars with a median value of 3168 dollars. The data also suggests that campaigns that had a very high goal amount are likely to fail. The data was also skewed to the left suggesting that there were **a few** successful high goal campaigns, but there might be other factors influencing the success as most of the high goal campaigns have failed.

## Edinburgh Report
The data for the below 5 plays were collated based on the client's request and can be viewed in detail on the 'Edinburgh Report' sheet in the file.

- Be Prepared
- Checkpoint 22
- Cutting Off Kate Bush
- Jestia and Raedon

## Campaigns for Musicals in GB
A high level analysis was carried out on campaigns for musicals in GB. From the data, it can be seen that the median pledged amount was 368 GBP with the range being 0-1496 GBP, which is considerably less than the 4000 GBP. Most of the goal amount, on the other hand, was in the higher range. Therefore, the ideal goal amount is **less than 1500 GBP**.

## Conclusion
In summary, to start a campaign for plays in the US, it would be ideal to start the campaign around May, with a goal amount between 1500 to 5000 dollars
